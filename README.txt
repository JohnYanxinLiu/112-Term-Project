The name of my term project is “Dancerush 112.” It is based on the rhythm arcade game
“Dancerush Stardom.” This game is based on the premise that there will be
rhythmic notes and sliders coming down on the screen and the player is meant to create user
input in the game to match the game objects. With a simplified version of the game, the player will
use keyboard inputs to create player inputs in the game.

The project should be run in vscode from the main.py file. With 15112 shortcuts, simply press cntrl + b and the game should start running

The project makes use of few modules, using only cmu_112_graphics and PIL/Pillow and Requests.
Both modules can be found and installed from the cmu 15112 website here (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-animations-part4.html)

There are no special shortcuts to know for this project.
